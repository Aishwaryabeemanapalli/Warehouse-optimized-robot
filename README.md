# Warehouse-optimized-robot

Main Idea:
The environment is an NxN grid, where there are shelves and empty slots inside the grid. The robot is supposed to function in such a way, when the user gives the orders it should pick the order by traversing the grid. 
Input taken :
The input is the grid size and the grid itself. Since we have to run the episode(orders taken) 1000 times, I let the computer choose the orders by using the random choice. The grid is a 2 dimensional list. 
Approach:
I have split the entire simulation of robot into various functions so that each function is capable of performing its own task and returning to the result. Since the robot uses sensors which are 80% accurate, we can consider this 80% as the movement of the robot in picking the right shelf from the orders given. This 80% is coded in a function called traversal(r,c) where the function takes the co-ordinates of the position in the grid where the robot is present and checks itâ€™s neighbors to find the shelf and that shelf is in ordered items. If present it is stored in a temporary list called temp_list. Here the temp_list contains one or more elements in the form of co-ordinates and the temp_list is returned. 
The 10% of the time the robot sensors fail and the robot thinks there is a shelf when it is not the case. To simulate this functionality I have coded it within a function called check_emptygrid(r,c). 
The 10% of the time the robot fails to detect a shelf even if it exists. This functionality is coded within a function called random_move(r,c).
These three methods/ functions do the simulation work which means they just do the check of shelves. 
After checking for the neighbors, the robot needs to make a move. For the movement of the robot I have coded a different function called move_neighbor(item_list). This function takes the input as the list of items ordered and then runs until all the items are visited by the robot. Adding the score (+3 for moving to the shelf and -1 for moving to empty place/ shelf that is not ordered) is done within this function only. Along with calculating the score I have counted the path length and the co-ordinates of the path to print it later. 
How can we know that the robot is 80% accurate?
Well, I have coded this functionality within a method called probability(). This method will return a random number from 1 to the number of shelves present in the grid. 
I have to take the orders a random choice and store in the list. This is done for 1000 times (1000 episodes) and each time orders are appended to new_list.  
After implementing these functionalities within their specific methods, I have to run the code for 1000 episodes. Everytime I run the loop, it checks if the items orderedWhile iterating through the loop, I have calculated the average score, shortest path and its length, longest path and its length. 
Assumptions :
1	After each order, the robot is at the location where it was and did not go to the first position in the grid.

Questions to be answered:
1	Average score for 1000 episodes = -44.068
2 Shortest path  [(0, 1), (0, 2)]
Length of shortest path =  2
